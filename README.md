# Analysis of TFT Double-Up Results: Prismatic Augments vs. None

## Introduction
This analysis stems from personal experiences in the Team Fight Tactics game (Riot), where there was a perceived trend of losing when selecting All Prismetic Augments. The goal was to explore the relationship between victory and the use of Prismetic Augments in order to improve the overall win rate.

## Dataset Information
The analysis is based on 29 previous match histories, where only 4 of these games had all three Augments set as Prismatic. To enhance the depth of the analysis, it would be beneficial to collect more data, including details such as the specific type of Augments chosen, their associated effects, player levels, compositions used, and other relevant variables.

For a more comprehensive analysis, additional data and variables could be considered to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between Prismatic Augments and performance in Team Fight Tactics.
